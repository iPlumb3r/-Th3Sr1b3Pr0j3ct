Use cases of the __Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct__ are made of examples of already built __Conceptionaries__.

In Short

Lessons learned
==
All used tools i the "example" section are in fact not very useful for managing conceptionary !!
Hereafter a synthesis of pros and cons for each tool
(This will help for the specification of a best-of-breed Conceptionary Manager)

GitHub
-
* Presentation : Each Concept "entry" is "ID Card". Multilangual seen as table. Look nice, very heavy to create and/or maintain.
* Semantic : this is absolutely no semantic in this tool
* Collaboration : Web based tool with possible collaboration via "Pull Request"
* Bonus : N/A

Roam
-
* Presentation : Each Concept "entry" is "ID Card" . Bullet only presentation. Multilangual seen as differents lines (not table).
* Semantic : this is absolutely no semantic in this tool. Roam note just connect Term togheter, but not Concept
* Collaboration :  Web based tool allowing an easy and intuitive collaboration
* Bonus : A graph overview feature (https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntangledBootstrap/graph) which is a usefull starting point for building an Ontology ...



Excel / Google SpreadSheet
-
* Presentation : Each Concept "entry" is a line of a table. There is no Concept "ID Card" presentation. ultilangual seen as differents lines
* Semantic : this is absolutely no semantic in this tool. Roam note just connect Term togheter, NOT Concept !
* Collaboration : Web based tool with possible collaboration. Comment mode.
