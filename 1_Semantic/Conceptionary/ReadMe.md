Important Remark
-
It is funny (or dramatic ;-) to notice that the __Semiotic Triangle__ which incarnate relations between :
* #st00 (The "Thing"), 
* #st10 (The "Signified") => its mental representation 
* #st20 (The "Signified) => more often the "Term" used to talk about it  

... make consensus from a conceptual point of view, but NOT from a terminological one !!!   
(Cf nb of terms at each extremity of the triangle)
