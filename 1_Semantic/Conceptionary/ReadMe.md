Important Remark
-
It is funny (or dramatic) to notice that The Semiotic Triangle which incarnate relations between :
* #st0 (The "Thing"), 
* #st1 (The "Signified") => its mental representation 
* #st2 (The "Signified) => more often the "Term" used to talk about it  

... make consensus from a conceptual point of view, but NOT from a terminological one !!!   
(Cf nb of terms at each extremity of the triangle)
