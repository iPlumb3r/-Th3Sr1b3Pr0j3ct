Semantic Model
==

Introduction 
-
The __Semantic Model__ show the links which are connecting all the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Signified)</a> of the __Conceptionary__

The "root" of this __Semantic Model__ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_of_reference">Semiotic Triangle" (or Triangle of Reference" or "Triangle of Meaning")</a>

It allows to build several kind of relations between <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Signified)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st20_Signifier.md">#st20 (Signifier)</a> ...   
... in order to give signification to <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Signified)</a>


Note
-
__Concept__ is a useful _alternative label_ for <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Signified)</a>   
__Term__ is a useful _alternative label_ for <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st20_Signifier.md">#st20 (Signifier)</a>

Main relations
-
3 type of relations allow to give a 360Â° degree meaning to each __Concept__ of the __Conceptionary__ :
* denotation : give a short description based on 1 __Term__ (or very few __Terms__)
* definition : give a necessary & sufficient description (usually based on others __Concepts__)
* annotation : give a complementary description (could be based on others __Concepts__)
