The "Semantic Model" show the links which are connecting <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Signified)</a> of the __Conceptionary__

The "root" of this model is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_of_reference">Semiotic Triangle" (or Triangle of Reference" or "Triangle of Meaning")</a>

It allows to build several kind of relations between <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Concept)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st20_Signifier.md">#st20 (Term)</a> ...   
... in order to give signification to <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Th3Sr1b3Pr0j3ct/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%23st10_Signified.md">#st10 (Concept)</a>
* denotation : give a short description based on 1 __Term__ (or very few __Terms__)
